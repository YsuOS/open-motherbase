man(1)                                                                                            man(1)

NAME
       man - format and dISplay the on-line manual pages

SYNOPSIS
       man [-acdfFhkKtwW] [--path] [-m system] [-p string] [-C config_file] [-M pathlISt] [-P pager] [-B
       browser] [-H htmlpager] [-S section_lISt] [section] name ...

DESCRIPTION
       man formats and dISplays the on-line manual pages.  If you specify section,  man  only  looks  in
       that section of the manual.  name IS normally the name of the manual page, which IS typically the
       name of a command, function, or file.  However, if name contains a slash (/) then man  interprets
       it as a file specification, so that you can do man ./foo.5 or even man /cd/foo/bar.1.gz.

       See below for a description of where man looks for the manual page files.
